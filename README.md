# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analysis

Welcome to the analysis of Phone Now using PowerBI. This project aims to analyze employee data in order to generate insights on gender imbalance at Phone Now and recommend solutions to improve diversity and inclusion among employees. 

I explored Microsoft PowerBI in analyzing this project. I loaded the data into PowerQuery for data cleaning and transformation, I wrore DAX functions to enable me answer some business questions after which i visualized the insights i had gotten using PowerBI Desktop.

Please find a detailed article on the analysis carried out, insights generated and recommendations made on Medium. You can find the link to this article here:
